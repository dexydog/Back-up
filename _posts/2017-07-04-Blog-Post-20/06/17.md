This lesson I got a lot of work done on code academy. I finished the section Pyg latin which was by far the hardest course in python so far which was kind of expected as it is later on in the overall python course. I then started the functions course which I completed the whole course which consisted of three main sections: Function Syntax, importing modules and Built-in Functions. I then started the course 'Taking a vacation' and completed one of the sections which was called ‘A review of Function Creation’
