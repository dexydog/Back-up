In this weeks lesson I continued to use python on codecademy. In this lesson I completed the section Conditionals & Control Flow. This section consisted of fifteen exercises and I was glad to get it finished as it was the most difficult section I had completed yet on codecademy![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/l6uhrco3fbXsssKBPYDmA_img_0.png).
