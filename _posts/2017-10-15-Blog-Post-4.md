In this week's IT lesson we continued to look at google sheets and how to make order forms and different components of an order form. The component we looked at this lesson was discounts and discount codes. We created a named range with different codes starting with the two different letters at the start to indicate what percentage of discount is given off the total price. We also used vlookup so the google sheet could search the named range and whether the code was valid or not.
