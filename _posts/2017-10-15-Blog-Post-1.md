This week in our first lesson back we started to look at google sheets and how they work. We looked at how to multiply different cells together by using =Product and to find the percentage of things and increase them by different cells by an amount. We also looked at how spreadsheets can be useful and what we were going to learn about in the next term.

Then we started to look at how to create an order form and the different components needed to make one including: price, quantity, total price and product. We completed this task for homework.
