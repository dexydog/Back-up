    <td>I learnt by reading through a google slide on how to blog on github and listened to what Mr Keen said about posting and common mistakes that were made by other pupils in the past. These included that special characters are not to be used in the title or filename. I also learnt that if your post is not "appearing" on your website you can press the button that says . That will reset the filename and title to something appropriate that will be able to “appear” on your website.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that sometimes I would forget that no special characters were allowed in titles e.g. £:;()&@/ but dashes are… confusing right? So the habit I need to work on is… let me think… oh yeah making sure that no special characters are in my title :;()/£&@?! but dashes are allowed. Still cannot get my head around dashes being allowed but not exclamation marks!!! God help me please.</td>

    <td>Next time I will make sure that no special characters are in my title /:;()£&@?! but dashes are allowed (Just getting my head around this point still).</td>
