In this lesson I continued my work on codecademy python. I then finished the section owning a store in the 'a day at the supermarket' course in which you learn how to manage the stock and price of each different product. I also completed the last section (of the same course) which was called ‘shopping trip!’. This meant that I had completed the course ‘a day at the supermarket’. I then started the course ‘student becomes the teacher’ but didn't complete a section.
