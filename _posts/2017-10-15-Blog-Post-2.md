In our second lesson in the new school year we looked at a stock sheet and how to make the quantity number cell change colours depending on the number in that certain cell. We were also taught about product codes and how to use them to search up which product that code equates to. We were also taught about the vlookup formula but didn't have time to put it into our sheet and we had to finish our stock sheet for homework with the buying price, selling price, product, product code and quantity.
