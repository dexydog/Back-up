In this week's lesson we looked at our stock sheet and sorted it using product codes and assigning each product different code like A1, A2, A3 etc. We then put this into a named range so that we could use the information by using the vlookup formula in an order form so the product is automatically put in the box by just simply putting =VLOOKUP(B7,StockHolding,2,TRUE). This means using the vlookup formula in cell B7 find the product in the named range "stockholding" column 2. The 'true' stands for is the column sorted alphabetically or numbered in the correct order. We then used this to make an order form and completed it for homework.
