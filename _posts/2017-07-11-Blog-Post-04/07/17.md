This week our class continued on the Codecademy website in the Python section. In this lesson I completed the course 'Taking a Vacation'  which consisted of two sections called ‘A Review of Function Creation’ and ‘Planes, Hotels and Automobiles’ . I then started a course called ‘Python Lists and Dictionaries’ which I finished. It contained two sections called ‘Lists’ and ‘List Capabilities and Functions’. I then started the course ‘A Day at the Supermarket’ and completed the first section called ‘Looping with Lists and Dictionaries’, but couldn't complete any more as I ran out of time.
